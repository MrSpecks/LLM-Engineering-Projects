# 🧠 LLM Engineering Projects 🌟📘✨

Welcome to my **LLM Engineering Projects** repository!  🚀📚💡  
This repo documents my hands-on journey through the **Mastering LLM Engineering** course.  ✨🛠️🌍  
Each project explores different aspects of working with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** — from prompt design and model integration to real-world applications like summarization, retrieval, and agents. 🤖🧩🔍

---

Each project lives in its own folder with: 📂📝⚡
- **Jupyter notebooks / code** implementing the project
- **Documentation** explaining the purpose, approach, and learnings

## 🚀 Projects 🌐📊🎯

### 1. Website Summarizer with Llama 3.2 (via Ollama)
A Jupyter notebook project that: 🖥️🌎📝
- Scrapes website content using **BeautifulSoup**
- Connects to a **locally running Llama 3.2 model** via the Ollama API
- Generates concise **markdown summaries** of webpages

---

### 2. AI Brochure Maker
A notebook that: 📰💻🎨
- Scrapes and analyzes a company website
- Identifies the most relevant sections (About, Services, Careers)
- Uses an LLM to generate **brochure-ready text**
- Produces structured JSON and text outputs for easy formatting

- Impact:
This project demonstrates the power of combining web scraping, intelligent link filtering, and Al-driven content generation to deliver ready-to-use marketing assets. It shows how **businesses can reduce costs, speed up content creation, and maintain consistent messaging** with minimal human input.

### 3. AI Q&A Bot
An interactive Q&A system in Jupyter that: 💬🤔⚙️
- Accepts user questions and queries
- Streams real-time responses from **OpenAI GPT models**
- Outputs answers in Markdown format
- Provides a conversational, step-by-step explanation style

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack 🐍🛠️🖥️

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebooks)
- **BeautifulSoup4** for web scraping
- **Requests** for HTTP requests
- **Ollama** to run Llama 3.2 locally
- **OpenAI API / GPT Models** for Q&A and summarization
- **dotenv** for secure API key management
- **Markdown rendering** in Jupyter

## 📈 Learning Goals 🎓📑🚀

Through these projects, I aim to: 🧠✨🔧
1. Gain a deep understanding of **LLM system design & integration**  
2. Experiment with **prompt engineering strategies**  
3. Build practical **LLM-powered applications**  
4. Document and share progress as I advance through the course
