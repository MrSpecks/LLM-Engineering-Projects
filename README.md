# 🧠 LLM Engineering Projects

Welcome to my **LLM Engineering Projects** repository!  
This repo documents my hands-on journey through the **Mastering LLM Engineering** course.  
Each project explores different aspects of working with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** — from prompt design and model integration to real-world applications like summarization, retrieval, and agents.

---


Each project lives in its own folder with:
- **Jupyter notebooks / code** implementing the project
- **Documentation** explaining the purpose, approach, and learnings

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. Website Summarizer with Llama 3.2 (via Ollama)
A Jupyter notebook project that:
- Scrapes website content using **BeautifulSoup**
- Connects to a **locally running Llama 3.2 model** via the Ollama API
- Generates concise **markdown summaries** of webpages

📂 Folder: [`project-1-website-summarizer`](./project-1-website-summarizer)

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebooks)
- **BeautifulSoup4** for web scraping
- **Requests** for HTTP requests
- **Ollama** to run Llama 3.2 locally
- **OpenAI-compatible API client** for model communication
- **Markdown rendering** in Jupyter

---

## 📈 Learning Goals

Through these projects, I aim to:
1. Gain a deep understanding of **LLM system design & integration**  
2. Experiment with **prompt engineering strategies**  
3. Build practical **LLM-powered applications**  
4. Document and share progress as I advance through the course
